# Path animator
<ul>
<li>You have a path and want to animate something going around the path.</li>
<li>The path animator returns the coordinate travelling around.</li>
<li>Together with the normal so any travelling object can point correctly.</li>
<li>It has a built-in debug draw of the path and the point travelling around.</li>
</ul>

## Normals
<ul>
<li>
  The red path has smooth normals. Even if the path is straight, the surface is circular.
</li>
<li>
  The yellow path also has smooth normals, but since there is an extra path node the smoothing is only around the corners.
</li>
<li>
  The blue paths have sharpened normals. Even with no extra points the normal is straight unless close to a path node.
</li>
<li>
  It can flip the normals for you.
</li>
</ul>

## Speed
<ul>
<li>
  Set a speed in pixels / s
</li>
<li>
  Or a speed in laps / s
<li>
  The path animator can respond to changes in the path and update the animator position if the path is made longer or shorter.
</ul>
  
  ## Example

@example
 * //This will complete an animation in 5 seconds and adapt to changes in the curve.
 * //If the curve is made longer, the animation will still take 5 seconds meaning the speed is increased.
 * const points = [{x: 0, y: 0}, {x: 100, y: 0}, {x: 200, y: 200}, {x: 300, y: 200}]
 * const pm = new PointAnimator()
 * pm.set_points_reference(points) // Add a list of points to interpolate between.
 * pm.duration = 5                 // Set a total of 5 seconds for the animation.
 * // Draw loop
 * pm.update(deltaTime/1000)       // Increment by the time in seconds passed since last frame.
 * pm.draw()                       // Optional: Use the built-in debug draw function to draw the point.
 *
 * @example
 * //This will complete an animation in 5 seconds, but keep this speed.
 * //If the curve is made longer, the animation will take longer to complete.
 * const points = [{x: 0, y: 0}, {x: 100, y: 0}, {x: 200, y: 200}, {x: 300, y: 200}]
 * const pm = new PointAnimator()
 * pm.set_points_reference(points) // Add a list of points to interpolate between.
 * let dpf = pm.length / 5         // Calculate distance / second only once based on the initial length.
 * // Draw loop
 * pm.duration = pm.length / dpf   // Adjust the speed to the length new curve.
 * pm.update(deltaTime/1000)       // Increment by the time in seconds passed since last frame.
 * pm.draw()                       // Optional: Use the built-in debug draw function to draw the point.
 *
 * 
 * @example
 * //This will complete an animation in 300 frames and adapt to changes in the curve.
 * const points = [{x: 0, y: 0}, {x: 100, y: 0}, {x: 200, y: 200}, {x: 300, y: 200}]
 * const pm = new PointAnimator()
 * pm.set_points_reference(points) // Add a list of points to interpolate between.
 * pm.duration = 300               // Set a total of 5 seconds for the animation.
 * // Draw loop
 * pm.update()                     // 
 * pm.draw()                       // Optional: Use the built-in debug draw function to draw the point.
 * 
 * @example 
 * // This will just draw normals along the curve.
 * const points = [{x: 0, y: 0}, {x: 100, y: 0}, {x: 200, y: 200}, {x: 300, y: 200}]
 * const pm = new PointAnimator()
 * pm.set_points_reference(points) // Add a list of points to interpolate between.
 * // Draw loop
 * pm.update()                     //
 * pm.draw_normals()               // Draw normals along the curve.
